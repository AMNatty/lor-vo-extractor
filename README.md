# lor-vo-extractor

LoR VO Extractor (also LoR Audio Extractor) is a simple GUI utility to extract voiceover files from the game Legends of Runeterra.

I do not plan to actively support this project, however PRs are welcome!


## Building

Building should be straightforward, open solution file in the root directory, compile and run.

That being said, you need to manually build one of the dependencies (and possibly add it as a reference) - [AssetStudio](https://github.com/493msi/AssetStudio).
